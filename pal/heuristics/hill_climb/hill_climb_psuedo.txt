While all tests don't pass:
    for each service:
        if service had things wrong (things missing or extra things):
            step service
    run tests


Each service knows a number that is its correctness. Correctness is defined as
number of queries intended for the service that are correctly sorted - number of
queries intended for the service that are incorrectly sorted - number of queries
intended for a different service that are caught by the service.

If this iteration's correctness is higher than or equal to the previous
iteration's, maintain the direction from the previous step, otherwise CHANGE!
